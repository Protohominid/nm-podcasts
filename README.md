# nm-podcasts
A simple podcast plugin for WordPress

Based on an article from css-tricks.com, I wanted a simple plugin to create the itunes-ready RSS feed and to feature the podcast on blog posts.

This plugin creates a custom post type "NM Podcasts", populates it with custom fields, creates a settings page, and adds a metabox to post edit pages to select a podcast. When one is selected it creates an unstyled promo box for the front end at the top of the post.

This is a bespoke plugin so there aren't many options to customize it. I'm fairly new to plugin development so I'm open to suggestions.
